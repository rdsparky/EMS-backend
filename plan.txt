1. **Event Management System**


Certainly! Breaking down the development of an Event Management System into sprint pipelines and feature-wise tasks for both React and Django developers can help in organized development. Below is a breakdown for each:

Sprint 1: Basic Setup and User Authentication
React:

Set up React project structure.
Create a basic layout for the frontend.
Implement user authentication UI components (login, signup, logout).
Connect the frontend to the Django backend for user authentication.
Django:

Set up a Django project and create necessary apps.
Configure user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system.
Implement API endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
Integrate Django REST framework for building the API.
Sprint 2: Event Creation and Listing
React:

Create UI components for displaying a list of events.
Implement a form for creating new events.
Connect the event creation form to the backend API for event creation.
Implement dynamic routing for viewing individual events.
Django:

Create models for events.
Implement API endpoints for fetching a list of events and retrieving individual events.
Develop views and serializers for handling event data.
Implement API endpoint for creating new events.
Sprint 3: Event Registration and Attendees
React:

Add registration functionality to the event details page.
Display the list of attendees for each event.
Implement user authentication checks to control access to certain pages.
Django:

Create models for event registrations and attendees.
Implement API endpoints for handling event registrations.
Update the event details API to include attendee information.
Implement backend logic to check and control user access to events.
Sprint 4: Real-time Updates and Notifications
React:

Integrate real-time updates using WebSocket for event changes.
Implement notifications for new events and updates.
Enhance the user interface with animations for real-time changes.
Django:

Integrate Django Channels for real-time updates.
Implement backend logic for sending notifications.
Develop API endpoints for handling real-time data.
Sprint 5: Scalability and Additional Features
React:

Implement pagination for the list of events.
Enhance the event creation form with additional details.
Implement advanced filters for event listings.
Django:

Optimize database queries for scalability.
Add additional fields to the event model for more details.
Implement backend logic for filtering and pagination.
Sprint 6: Testing and Deployment
React:

Write unit tests for React components and UI functionality.
Set up continuous integration for frontend code.
Prepare the React app for deployment.
Django:

Write unit tests for Django models, views, and API endpoints.
Set up continuous integration for backend code.
Prepare the Django app for deployment.
This breakdown provides a rough outline of sprints and feature-wise tasks for both React and Django development. Adjustments can be made based on the team's capacity and project requirements.
